Objectives

	1. improving the ability to use numbers, operators, and arithmetic operations in Python;
	2. using the print() function's formatting capabilities;
	3. learning to express everyday-life phenomena in terms of programming language.

Scenario
Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.

Don't worry about any imperfections in your code - it's okay if it accepts an invalid time - the most important thing is that the code produce valid results for valid input data.

Test your code carefully. Hint: using the % operator may be the key to success.

Test Data
Sample input:
12
17
59

Expected output: 13:16
